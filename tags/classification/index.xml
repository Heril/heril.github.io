      <description>Time for something a bit different from my previous posts, but hopefully more common in the future.
I was looking through the UCI Machine Learning Repository for a couple of data sets I could use for some simple machine learning problems to try interesting problems and keep my abilities sharp. This week I found the Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction. This comes from a paper on early prediction of diabetes risk. The abstract goes over the methods used, indicating Random Forest as doing particularly well. Since I donâ€™t have access to the actual paper, I wanted to try out using R to try this model out.</description>
