      <description>So, after my last Dungeons and Dragons post, I got asked about the Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic in Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition, so let’s look into that a bit.
In D&amp;amp;D, to succeed at a task, you roll a 20-sided die(d20) and with some math and checking with your Dungeon Master (DM), you determine if you succeed or not. In previous editions you would add your character’s modifier, as well as any additional bonuses or penalties due to the specific scenario. Fifth edition got rid of that except for one specific case, and instead replaced it with Advantage/Disadvantage.
Simply put, if your character is in some sort of advantageous situation when attempting a task, you get Advantage.</description>
