      <description>So, after sharing my post from last week about probabilities and stat arrays. Now, the way I determine which array is better is clearly overly arbitrary. Under that system the standard array is better than an array of (7, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18), when in reality any player looking for maximal stats would take that over the standard array (8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15). So maybe there is a different way to compare these.
Now the first approach would be to just take the ability modifier. Each integer from 3-18 maps to an integer from -4 to +4 that is used for almost everything in the game (except for carrying capacity, which uses the actual Strength score).</description>
