      <description>Earlier this year, I posted the first part of a write-up for a project I worked on during a project I worked on last year.
As a reminder, my project involved taking 4 different types of correlation, test the baseline and 8 different data shifts, generating 1000 simulations with 100 points of data each. I then compared how three different multivariate control charts, Hotelling T^2, MEWMA, and MCUSUM, were in detecting a shift while holding the false rate fixed over all simulations.</description>
